### Hi, my name is Aditi 
**I am a web developer who is currently learning about cloud technology. In my free time, I love to dance.**

I have always been interested in computers and technology, and I decided to pursue a career in web development because it combines my love of technology with my passion for creative problem solving. I am constantly learning and staying up-to-date on the latest trends and techniques in the field.

Recently, I have been focusing on learning about cloud technology and how it can be used to build and deploy web applications. It is an exciting and rapidly growing area, and I am thrilled to be able to learn and work with this technology.

When I am not working or learning about technology, I love to dance. It is a great way for me to relieve stress and express myself creatively. 

Overall, I am a passionate and dedicated person who loves to learn and grow in my career. I am excited to see where my love of technology will take me in the future.
